Synchronize an arbtirary set of data from one ldap environment to
another.  Configuration is flexible enough to handle disparate schemas
and DITs.  

It's a good idea to list each ou separately with a scope of one unless
you're pretty certain your uniqueattr (ie uid or cn) is unique across
all OUs.  This is more likely to be true for uid than cn in many
cases.

It's a good idea to run with -f periodically to catch any changes that
might have been missed--timestamps are good but not perfect.

- source and dest data sets are arbitrary ldap searches
- automatically converts attributes that contain DN as values
- designed to be run every few minutes, automatically stores
  timestamps and searches for changes made since last timestamp
- depends on convert_ldap.pl (stored in a separate repository) to
  convert account entries during adds
- only generates a log file if there was a change
- includes a shell script that collects log files, prints a summary and archives the logs

Designed to be run out of cron.  Sample configuration:
#  don't run run_selective_ldap_sync.sh and print_and_compress_logs.sh at the same time or the latter
#  will capture an empty log from the former each time it runs
#  recurring incremental update.
*/5 * * * * /path/to/selective_ldap_sync/run_selective_ldap_sync.sh > /dev/null
# nightly full update: catch anything missed during incrementals.
1 1 * * *  /path/to/selective_ldap_sync/run_selective_ldap_sync.sh -f > /dev/null
1 15 * * * /path/to/selective_ldap_sync/print_and_compress_logs.sh 2>&1 | mailx -s "ldap sync summary" emailaddr@domain.org


TODO:

- The configuration currently requires separate config sections for
  adding and sync'ing attributes.  This is relatively straightforward
  and laid out in the sample cf file but obviously not ideal.
- It was written quickly to solve a problem.  It has been in production for some time and works well.
     - but it's not laid out the best
     - the error reporting isn't the best
